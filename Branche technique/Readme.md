## Tasks

### 1. Autoformation Laravel
- The primary goal of this branch is to focus on Laravel autoformation.
- Please start by creating a step-by-step guide or tutorial for self-learning and improvement in Laravel.
- Include best practices, tips, and tricks for mastering Laravel.

### 2. CRUD Operations
- Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in Laravel.
- Create a set of routes, controllers, and views to manage a specific resource within our application.
- Make sure to follow Laravel's conventions and best practices.

### 3. Laravel Standards
- Adhere to Laravel coding standards and best practices throughout the branch.
- Write clean, well-documented, and organized code.
- Ensure proper use of Eloquent ORM, middleware, and validation.
- Use Laravel's built-in features whenever possible to minimize code duplication.

### 4. Prototypes
- Develop prototypes for new features or improvements.
- Use wireframes, mockups, or interactive prototypes to visualize the changes.
- Collaborate with the design team to ensure consistency in the user interface.

## Branch Guidelines
- Create a new branch based on this one for each specific task (e.g., `feature/autoformation`, `feature/crud`, etc.).
- Work on each task in a separate branch to keep changes isolated.
- Regularly commit and push your changes to the corresponding branch.
- Use meaningful commit messages and reference issue numbers if applicable.

## Documentation
- Keep the project documentation updated with any changes you make.
- Write detailed explanations for the autoformation, CRUD operations, and prototypes.
- Include relevant diagrams, code snippets, and usage instructions.

## Testing
- Write unit and integration tests for your code.
- Ensure that all tests pass before merging your changes into the main branch.
- Follow PHPUnit and Laravel testing best practices.

## Review
- Seek code reviews from peers before merging your changes.
- Make sure the code adheres to the established standards and practices.
- Address any feedback and make necessary revisions.
